		<p>
			I am a first-year student at UCLA studying mathematics and economics with a specialization in computing. Although I have not found a singular career I would like to pursue, my current aspirations include (but not limited to) software development, management consulting, medicine and academia. 

			I am a naturally curious person and love self learning. I am fascinated in many topics including politics, sports, cinema, etc. As a result, I started my blog in order to express my opinions with the world and hopefully give viewers a new perspective not only a particular topic, but also life. I also enjoy constructive criticism and feedback so feel free to contact me.

			On my free time, I enjoy staying active, trying new restaurants and solving the Rubik's cube (and other puzzles). If you would like to connect, email me at

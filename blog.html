			<h2>America in Crisis and a Possible Solution</h2>
		</header>
		<img src="protest.img">
		<p>
			Everyday when I wake up, I do a couple stretches, brush my teeth, and scroll through social media. Most days, my feed is crowded with NBA highlights, inspiration quotes and mildly comical videos with captions that make it seem like their are comedic geniuses. 
		</p>
		<p>
			However, this for the past couple days, there has been a lack of entertainment, replaced with news about the tragic death of George Floyd.
		</p>
		<p>
			For those who are unaware of the situation or are confused about what exactly happened, on May 26, George Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, was killed by then police officer Derek Chauvin who pressed his knee into Floyd's neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds.
		</p>
		<p>
			The video of the scene has surfaced and spread like wildfire across social media. This spawned a wave of protests and awareness of America's rampant racial injustices. 
		</p>
		<p>
			However, this death is not like any other. Other black men just this year fell victim to race-based discrimination. Namely, then 25 year-old Ahmaud Arbery was shot and killed by a father-son white duo while he was running. While this death ended in protests and social media pleads for support to help end racism, Floyd's death opened an treated wound that was supposedly treated in the 1960s: equality for black men and women.
		</p>
		<p>
			Even though the deadly Covid-19 virus continues to takes hundreds of thousands of lives in the United States, protesters take to the street despite social distancing orders and demand for justice. While I would usually condemn any act that endangers public safety during a serious pandemic like Covid-19, not this time. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The United States thus far has done a very poor job of containing the spread of the virus. In more densely populated places like South Korea and Taiwan, the outbreak has been reasonably controlled and people are starting to go back to their normal lives. The US, on the other hand, has been far from proactive in their control of the virus, leading to longer and longer stay at home orders. 
		</p>
		<p>
			And that's one key contributer to the scale of the Floyd protests. People want to go out. People hold such disapproval for the government (and particularly this administration) and Floyd's untimely death gives them a vehicle to express their discontent.
		</p>
		<p>
			However, it would not do justice to the gravity of the situation to solely point to prolonged isolation as the cause of the hundreds of protests that are occuring nationwide. The real tipping point is seen in the video of Floyd's death. Chauvin's seemingly inhumane and indifference to human life led to his inaction to list to Floyd's struggles and pleads. This is the largest contributer to these protests, both peaceful and violent.
		</p>
		<p>
			Though there are major differences between the LA riots in 1992 and Floyd's death, there are also striking similarities, such as the way King and Floyd were savagely treated and the riots ensuing after the deaths of both. However, the ending of the LA riots was far from satisfactory and I fear that history may repeat itself.
		</p>
		<p>
			As a young Asian-American man, I am left to wonder what possible outcomes may come out of this. I can never feel the rage the Black community may feel nor could I do justice trying to explain it. While I support the push for racial justice for all (especially the black community for the historic disadvantages they face), I believe that focusing on mental health in the US can help largely combat these issues.
		</p>
		<p>
			Mental health is a serious issue that has plagued our nation, and it is getting serious to a point where if you are completely happy with your life, it has become the new abnormal. I strongly believe that most violence in our world derives from underlying, undiagnosed mental health issues such as extreme stress and anxiety.
		</p>
		<p>
			By pouring more funding into mental health, and seriously and consistently testing law enforcement, we will see less violence and abuse. Additionally, those who are in a mentally healthy state are open to new ideas and perspectives, leading to less racism.
		</p>
		<p>
			With that said, no one wants to be called mentally unstable, even if they unknowingly are. We need create the narrative that weakness is acceptable and a perfectly normal part of life. The easiest way to change this is the same way we are fighting for racial justice right now: social media. 2016 NBA Champion Kevin Love has been one of the biggest advocates for mental health and if those with a larger fanbase can commit a message as strong as his, the younger generation that idolize these celebrities will follow and the discussion will really be taken seriously.
		</p>
		<p>
			Continue to take to social media about the racial injustice and continue to donate to those who need it. But I also implore you to think of different solutions to our modern problems. While considerations on mental health may bring about change slowly, it will greatly eradicate hateful behaviour in the future.
